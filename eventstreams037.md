# Using the Administration REST API
{: #admin_api}

{{site.data.keyword.messagehub}} provides an Administration RESTful API that you can use to create, delete, list, and update topics.
{: shortdesc}

You must retrieve the URL and credential details that are needed to connect to the API from a Service credentials object or service key for the service instance. For information about creating these objects, see 
[Connecting to {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}}](/docs/services/EventStreams?topic=eventstreams-connecting).

The URL for the API's endpoint is provided in the <code>kafka_admin_url</code>property.

The credentials depend on the authentication method and three types of credential are supported:

* **To authenticate using Basic Auth**:<br/> 
    Use the <code>user</code> and <code>api_key</code> properties of the above objects as the username and password. Place these values into the <code>Authorization</code> header of the HTTP request in the form <code>Basic <base64 encoding of username:password joined by a single colon (:)></code>.

* **To authenticate using a bearer token:**<br/> 
    To obtain your token using the IBM Cloud CLI, first log in to IBM Cloud then run the following command: 

    ```
    ibmcloud iam oauth-tokens
    ```
    {: codeblock}

    Place this token in the Authorization header of the HTTP request in the form <code>Bearer <token></code>. Both API key or JWT tokens are supported. 

* ** To authenticate directly using the api_key:**<br/>
    Place the key directly as the value of the <code>X-Auth-Token</code> HTTP header.

For service instances created on the Classic plan, this information is available from your application's VCAP_SERVICES environment variable instead.
