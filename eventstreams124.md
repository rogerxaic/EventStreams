# Managing access to your {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}} resources (Enterprise plan)
{: #security }

You can secure your {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}} resources in a fine-grained manner to manage the access that you want to grant each user to each resource.
{: shortdesc}

When you make changes to IAM policies and permissions, these can sometimes take several minutes to be reflected in the underlying service.
{: important}

## What can I secure?

Within {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}}, you can secure access to the following resources:
* Cluster (cluster): you can control which applications and users can connect to the service
* Topics (topic): you can control the ability of users and applications to create, delete, read, and write to a topic 
* Consumer groups (group): you can control an application's ability to join a consumer group 
* Producer transactions (txnid): you can control the ability to use the transactional producer capability in Kafka (that is, single, atomic writes across multiple partitions)

The levels of access (also known as a role) that you can assign to a user to each resource are as follows:

| Access role | Description of actions | Example actions |
|:-----------------|:-----------------|:-----------------|
|  Reader | Perform read-only actions within {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}} such as viewing resources | Allow an app to connect to a cluster by assigning read access to cluster resource type |
| Writer | Writers have permissions beyond the reader role, including creating and editing {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}} resources. | Allow an app to produce to topics by assigning write access to topic resource and topic name types|
| Manager | Managers have permissions beyond the writer role to complete privileged actions. In addition, you can create and edit {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}} resources. | Allow full access to all resources by assigning manage access to the {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}} instance|

<!-- comment from Charlie and my reply 
CM: need to confirm if hierarchical e.g. write includes read - and doc. 
KR: I think they do inherit the lower level access https://console.bluemix.net/docs/iam/users_roles.html#iamusermanrol

## How do I assign access?

Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies are attached to the resources to be controlled. Each policy defines the level of access that a particular user should have and to which resource or set of resources. A policy consists of the following information: 
* The type of service the policy applies to. For example, {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}}. You can scope a policy to include all service types. 
* The instance of the service to be secured. You can scope a policy to include all instances of a service type. 
* The type of resource to be secured. The valid values are <code>cluster</code>, <code>topic</code>, <code>group</code>, or <code>txnid</code>. Specifying a type is optional. If you do not specify a type, the policy then applies to all resources in the service instance. 
* The resource to be secured. Specify for resources of type <code>topic</code>, <code>group</code> and <code>txnid</code>. If you do not specify the resource, the policy then applies to all resources of the type specified in the service instance. 
* The role assigned to the user. For example, Reader, Writer, or Manager. 

## What are the default security settings?

By default, when {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}} is provisioned, the user who provisioned it is granted the manager role to all the instance's resources. Additionally, any user who has a manager role for either 'All' services or 'All' {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}} service instances' in the same account also has full access. 

You can then apply additional policies to extend access to other users. You can either scope a policy to apply to {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}} as a whole or to individual resources within {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}}. For more information, see [Common scenarios](#security_scenarios).

Only users with an administration role for an account can assign policies to users . Assign policies either by using IBM Cloud dashboard or by using the **ibmcloud** commands.
