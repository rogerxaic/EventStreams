# Watson IoT Platform bridge
{: #consuming_messages }


{{site.data.keyword.iot_full}} provides a managed bridge that allows you to create a unidirectional link to {{site.data.keyword.messagehub_full}}.
{: shortdesc}

Connecting {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}} to {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} means that you can use {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}} as an event pipeline to consume your device events from the {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} and to make the events available in real time to the rest of the platform. 

A common pattern is to use the {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} bridge, {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}}, and the Cloud Object Storage bridge to create an end-to-end pipeline, which makes real-time and batch interactions easier.

For information about to how to create this bridge, see: [Connecting and configuring a historian service by using {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}}  ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](/docs/services/IoT/message_hub.html#messagehub_main){:new_window}.
