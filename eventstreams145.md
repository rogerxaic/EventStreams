# Restricting network access using the Enterprise plan
{: #restrict_access}

By default, {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}} permits access from any IP address on the public internet. If you are using an instance of the {{site.data.keyword.vpc_full}}, you are recommended to apply the following restrictions so that only designated virtual server instances (VSIs) within your Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) can establish network connections to the {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}} instance. 
{:shortdesc}

Enable [Cloud Service Endpoints (CSE) ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/direct-link?topic=direct-link-overview-of-virtual-routing-and-forwarding-vrf-on-ibm-cloud){:new_window} to restrict access to any source IP address on the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_short}} network. When you implement IP address whitelisting on the Cloud Service endpoints, access is restricted to VSIs with specified VPCs. 

If you're using IKS, you can restrict access by including the private IP addresses of the nodes in your clusters that require access to the {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}} endpoints.

## Prerequisites
{: #prereqs_restrict_access}

Ensure that you complete the following tasks:
* Create your service instance by using the Enterprise plan. For more information, see 
[Choosing your plan ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](/docs/EventStreams?topic=eventstreams-plan_choose){:new_window}.
* Enable [Virtual Route Forwarding (VRF) ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](/docs/direct-link?topic=direct-link-overview-of-virtual-routing-and-forwarding-vrf-on-ibm-cloud){:new_window} for your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_short}} account.
* Ensure Virtual Private Cloud instance is Cloud Service endpoint enabled.

## Obtaining Virtual Private Cloud CSE source IP addresses
{: #vpc_ip}

If you want to restrict access to VSIs hosted within a specific VPC, you first have to discover the VPC source IP addresses. 

1. Obtain the ID of the VPC from the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Infrastructure console:

   ```
export VPC_ID=<vpc_id>
   ```
   {: codeblock}

2. Obtain a bearer token from IAM using the ibmcloud CLI:

   ```
   export IAM_TOKEN=$(bx iam oauth-tokens --output json | jq -r .iam_token)
   ```
   {: codeblock}

3. Use the VPC REST API to obtain the source IP addresses:

   ```
   curl -H "Authorization: $IAM_TOKEN" "https://us-south.iaas.cloud.ibm.com/v1/vpcs/$VPC_ID?version=2019-10-15&generation=1" 2>/dev/null | jq -r'.cse_source_ips | .[] | "\(.ip)/32"'
   ```
   {: codeblock}

## Enabling {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Service endpoints 
{: #enable_endpoints}

To add an {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} service endpoint:

* Raise a [ticket ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](/docs/get-support?topic=get-support-getting-customer-support#using-avatar){:new_window} to request an {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} service endpoint. Provide the following information in the ticket:

    * Your cluster ID, if you know it. 
    
    If you don't know the cluster ID, please provide your dashboard URL, the Kafka broker endpoints, or your service instance ID instead.
* If you want to restrict access to your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} service endpoint to individual VPCs only, include the [VPC CSE source IP addresses](#vpc_ip) in the ticket.
* If you're using IKS, you can restrict access by including the node addresses of your clusters.

## After switching to an {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} service endpoint 
{: #after_endpoints}

When you have switched to an {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} service endpoint, the external or public endpoints are no longer available to you. This means that although existing credentials continue to be valid, the Kafka endpoints and HTTP endpoints in any pre-existing service credentials are no longer valid.

### Accessing the IBM {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}} console
{: #access_console}

When a cluster has private endpoints enabled, the admin URL that you use to access the {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}} console changes.

The {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}} console is reachable only from a private admin URL. To discover your private endpoints, including the private admin URL, you can create a new service credential.

Because the {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}} instance endpoints have now been converted to be accessed from the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} only, the {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}} console is accessible only using a web browser that is hosted on the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} network.
